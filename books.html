 <p class="text" style="float: right;">One of my favorite hobbies is reading; being transported into another world with each and every word I read. It takes you away from the world you are currrently in and takes you to a place full of magic, mystery, thrills, action, suspence, ect. For me it is the perfect way to just calm down and take a break from the world. Here are some of my favorite books, authors, and just music to think or read to. Setting aside time to just take a break from the world and dive into another one is something</p>
